# The script is run plainly in IDE and prints the output in console

## Please pay attention to comments and console.logs, as those are crucial in order to grasp the I/O data 

- To generate valid data : an input array is needed
- The fields for generated user are hardcoded (both: transactions, holdings)
- TICKER -> ISIN switch is now smart :unicorn: !

### I am super excited to receive any feedback and improve the script
