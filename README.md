## The script is run plainly in IDE and prints the output in console

# Please pay attention to comments and console.logs, as those are crucial in order to grasp the I/O data 

- To generate valid data : an input array is needed
- The fields for generated user are hardcoded (both: transactions, holdings)
- To switch from TICKERs to ISINs we need to manually hunt and edit all occurances (WiP :unicorn:)

# I am super excited to receive any feedback and improve the script
